# Snake
My work on the [OpenAI Requests for Research 2.0][1] Snake problem:
> Implement a clone of the classic Snake game as a Gym environment,
and solve it with a reinforcement learning algorithm of your choice.
Tweet us videos of the agent playing. Were you able to train a policy
that wins the game?

## Progress
Currently, Snake is implemented using `pygame`. To play the
game, run `main.py`.
